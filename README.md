# Electrical Engineering Student / Embedded Developer

Engineer student who loves to code and learn is always hard at work, which I think is the key to success.

## Featured Project 
The project that is mostly included is a pen that I made to be a study tool that was 3D desgined, coded, and built, that used 3D design AI trainning many models and coded to fit my needs. Using a camera embedded in the pen would look at a question and give an answer.
